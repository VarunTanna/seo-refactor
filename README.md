## Description
I used On-Site Opitmization to help clean up this webpage and make it just as effective but with less syntax.
I did so by doing the following:

- Changed html syntax's such as divs to the following:
    1. Divs to Nav.
    2. Divs to Main.
    3. Divs to Articles.
    4. Divs to Aside.
    5. Divs to Sections.
    6. Added abbr tags for SEO.

- Changed css syntax to correspond with the html layout doing the following:
    1. Used the header elemment to nessle the h1 and .seo elements.
    2. Used the nav element to keep our articles grouped.
    3. Used nav a elements to add the propper css propeties.
    4. Used aside element to group sections and the elements inside.
    5. Used the benefit class to group together the imgs and h3s.
    6. Used the article element to group together the img and h2.
